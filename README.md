Hello everyone,

My name is Nadhira, and I am delighted to be here today. I am from Indonesia, and I have a background in Programming. I completed my Bachelor's degree at the Islamic University of North Sumatra, where I focused on Informatics Engineering.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, as I believe family is the most comfortable home, especially when I am with my mom and dad. My mom and dad have been my support system since I was a child, and because of them, I have been able to overcome all the challenges up to this point. I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges.

I am looking forward to connecting with all of you and exchanging ideas. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better.

Best regards,

Nadhira
